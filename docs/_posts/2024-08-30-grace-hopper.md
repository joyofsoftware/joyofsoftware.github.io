The NSA has released the famous [Future Possibilities](https://www.nsa.gov/helpful-links/nsa-foia/declassification-transparency-initiatives/historical-releases/view/article/3880193/capt-grace-hopper-on-future-possibilities-data-hardware-software-and-people-1982/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} lecture given by Rear Admiral Grace Hopper (she was still a Navy Captain at the time) to an NSA audience in August of 1982. Over 40 years later, her comments remain insightful, inspiring and forward looking. Rear Admiral Hopper touches on topics covering data, software development, security and leadership with humor and humilty while delivering sage advice.

For those who prefer to read rather than watch, the US Department of Energy has a scanned copy of a version of the talk given a few years later to an audience at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, [Future Possibilities hardcopy](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/6566336){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
