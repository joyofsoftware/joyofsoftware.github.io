## Welcome!

Why **JOY of SOFTWARE**? Well, my wife's name is Joy and software also brings me joy so that is a very happy coincidence. You may also notice that the JOY of SOFTWARE logo looks very similar to the famous tome, [Joy of Cooking](https://www.simonandschuster.com/p/joy-of-cooking){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. In the mid seventies, home alone after school I started to explore the family copy of Joy of Cooking. Around the same time the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [IMSAI 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSAI_8080){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} were introduced and I was drawn to the hardware, especially the IMSAI because of all those switches on the front. But as I learned about these new microcomputers I became fascinated with the concept of software. A set of intructions, a series of ones and zeros could alter what the computer did and how it behaved. Software could be stored and reloaded, it could change execution based on inputs, it could even alter itself! I was hooked. My mom managed to enroll my middle school self in computer classes at a local college (thanks mom!) where I learned to program using punch cards on an [IBM System/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Software has brought me great joy ever since.
